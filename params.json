It has been developed using Xcode 5 & tested against iOS 7.x.\r\n##### Documentation\r\n[Latest HTML documentation](http://keithermel.github.io/BTLELib/docs/index.html)\r\n\r\nThe Xcode project includes a `Documentation` target which can be used to generate documentation for the API. \r\n\r\nIt requires the use of [appledoc](http://gentlebytes.com/appledoc/). \r\n\r\nOnce you've built the documentation it will be available through Xcode's Documentation window.\r\n\r\n##### Examples\r\n* The <code>[BTLELibExample](https://github.com/KeithErmel/BTLELib/tree/master/Examples/BTLELibExample)</code> sends a bit over 10K of data to a receiver\r\n* Requires two devices running the example app\r\n* One serves as sender, the other as receiver; user selectable\r\n* Provides progress updates to UI via progress bar on both the sending & receiving devices\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
